# Linear Regression Predictions

This project focuses on building a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on relevant features like size, location, and number of bedrooms. The project follows a project-based learning approach to help you gain hands-on experience in AI/ML development.

## Project Structure

The project is organized with the following file structure:

- **data/**: Contains the dataset file, "realtor-data.csv," which contains the housing data.
- **notebooks/**: Contains the Jupyter Notebook or Python script for the project, "linear_regression.ipynb."
- **models/**: Reserved for storing trained machine learning models (if applicable).
- **utils/**: Contains utility functions or modules for data preprocessing, evaluation, or other purposes.
- **README.md**: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- Required Python libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.) specified in the project's dependencies file (requirements.txt, if applicable).

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Navigate to the "notebooks/" directory and open the "linear_regression.ipynb" notebook in Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python IDE.

4. Follow the instructions and code comments in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build a linear regression model, and make predictions.

5. Modify and experiment with the code as needed, incorporating additional techniques or optimizations.

## Resources

- Dataset: The project utilizes the "USA Real Estate Dataset" (realtor-data.csv), containing housing information such as size, location, and price.
